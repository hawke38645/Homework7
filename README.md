# Insurance Score Calculator

     This program reads a file that contains health details of different individuals and stores them in InsuranceMember 
  objects. It then gives a menu option of adding new members or running insurance score calculations on all of them. It also 
  provides the option to write the files to text, binary, or JSON file formats.
